# ETL and Predictive Models for Sales Support in the Manufacturing Sector

## üìò Overview
This project explores the application of **Data Analytics** and **Machine Learning** in the manufacturing industry, focusing on technological innovation to support sales processes.  
The work involves the **design and development of ETL systems** and **predictive models** for analyzing and improving sales strategies in the **tire manufacturing sector**.

## üß© Objectives
- Develop an **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load)** system to monitor:
  - Potentially sellable products based on the analysis of the circulating vehicle fleet.
  - Customer sales performance and commercial statistics.  
- Build **predictive models** to identify products sellable to customers using:
  - **Customer Mix**: historical purchasing behavior and product lifecycle analysis.
  - **Market Mix**: global and local market data to forecast customer needs.
- Apply **machine learning techniques** to forecast purchase quantities based on monthly data (2013‚Äì2024).

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technologies & Tools
- **Python** for data processing, analysis, and model development  
- **ETL Pipelines** for data extraction, transformation, and loading  
- **Machine Learning** for predictive modeling and forecasting  
- **Data Visualization** for performance monitoring and insights  

## üìä Results
The developed models demonstrate how data-driven approaches can significantly improve the **efficiency and effectiveness of sales strategies**, enabling manufacturing companies to:
- Anticipate customer needs
- Optimize production planning
- Enhance competitive advantage in the global market

## üß† Future Developments
- Integration of real-time data streams into the ETL workflow  
- Optimization of predictive models with advanced ML algorithms  
- Extension of the system to other manufacturing contexts
